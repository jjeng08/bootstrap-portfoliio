			<p>Ah, hello! You don't look Hollow, far from it! I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight. Now
				that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun! â€¦ Do you
				find that strange? Well, you should! No need to hide your reaction. I get that look all the time! Hah hah hah! Oh,
				ah hah! </p>
			<p>So, I didn't scare you? I have a proposition, if you have a moment. The way I see it, our fates appear to be
				intertwined. In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere chance? So, what do you say? Why not help
				one another on this lonely journey?</p>
			<p>This pleases me greatly! Well then, take this. We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land. The flow of time
				itself is convoluted, with heroes centuries old phasing in and out. The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and
				obscure. There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact. But, use this, to summon
				one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation! </p>
			<p>Of course, we are not the only one engaged in this. But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature
				easily by its brilliant aura. If you miss it, you must be blind! Hah hah hah!</p>
